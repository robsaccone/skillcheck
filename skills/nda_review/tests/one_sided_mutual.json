      "description": "Acme's CI is defined as 'any and all information disclosed by or on behalf of Acme Technologies' with no marking requirement. Recipient's CI requires written disclosures to be conspicuously marked 'CONFIDENTIAL' at the time of disclosure, and oral/visual disclosures to be identified as confidential at the time AND confirmed in a written summary within 5 business days. Information not marked or confirmed is explicitly excluded.",
      "rubric": "Did the response identify that the CI definitions are asymmetric between the parties — specifically that Acme has no marking requirement while Recipient must mark written disclosures and confirm oral disclosures in writing within 5 business days?"

      "description": "Recipient may only disclose Acme's CI to employees, agents, and contractors. Acme may disclose Recipient's CI to a much broader set including affiliates, subsidiaries, investors, lenders, potential acquirers, and professional advisors, and for purposes beyond the stated Purpose including management, financing, or strategic planning of Acme's business.",
      "rubric": "Did the response identify that sections 3.4 and 3.5 grant different disclosure permissions to the two parties, particularly flagging the 'potential acquirers' language or the expanded purpose?"
