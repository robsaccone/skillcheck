# NDA Review: Client-Perspective Checklist

*A practical, business-oriented approach to NDA review from the client's perspective.*

You are reviewing a Non-Disclosure Agreement on behalf of a client. Apply the following client-perspective checklist, thinking about each consideration from the standpoint of what the client is actually protecting or giving up, and why.

## Pre-Review Assessment

Before analyzing individual provisions, answer these threshold questions:

1. **Information flow**: What confidential information does the client expect to SHARE, and what does it expect to RECEIVE? If the client isn't disclosing anything confidential, inadequate protections for CI matter less.
2. **One-way vs. mutual**: Is this genuinely mutual, or does it only protect one party's information? Mutual NDAs are usually titled as such; one-way NDAs rarely say they are one-way. Read carefully.
3. **If one-way, should it be mutual?** If both parties will share confidential information, push for a mutual NDA.

## Provision-by-Provision Review

For each area below, assess whether the provision is adequate, identify any concerns, and note what the client should negotiate:

### Definition of Confidential Information
- Is CI defined with appropriate precision?
- Are proper exemptions included (independently obtained information, information from third parties, independently derived information)?
- Understand the Disclosing Party's obligation to IDENTIFY CI: Does the agreement require marking at the time of disclosure? Or does it require the Receiving Party to treat anything it should reasonably understand as CI? Both approaches are common and can be appropriate — but the client should understand which applies.

### Permitted Use and Disclosure
- Is the Receiving Party's use of CI limited to the stated Purpose?
- Is CI being used for purposes OUTSIDE what the client intends?
- Can the Receiving Party disclose CI to its personnel (affiliates, attorneys, consultants, employees, officers)?
- Without a provision allowing disclosure to personnel, each person who accesses CI may need to execute the NDA separately.
- The more concerned you are about disclosure, the more you want to maintain an up-to-date list of who has access.

### Compelled Disclosure
- Can the Receiving Party disclose CI when required by law?
- Does the clause provide the Disclosing Party with adequate NOTICE and opportunity to intervene?

### Term and Survival
- Is the term of the confidentiality obligation reasonable — does it last long enough?
- The obligation should extend beyond the termination of the relationship, but for how long?
- If the CI goes stale quickly, a shorter term may be equally effective with less burden.

### Return or Destruction of CI
- What happens to CI upon termination?
- Does the agreement allow an archival copy? (An archival copy can help resolve future disputes about what was actually disclosed.)
- Ideally, include language permitting retention of CI in automated archival or backup systems.

### Relationship Disclaimers
- Does the NDA include appropriate disclaimers? (No obligation to transact, no joint venture, no agency, etc.)

### Remedies and Dispute Resolution
- Does it provide for injunctive relief in case of breach?
- Is there a specific venue and applicable law?
- Consider: litigating venue questions can be very expensive. Assent to jurisdiction can be critical.

## Output Format

Structure your review as:

**THRESHOLD ASSESSMENT**: Describe the information flow, whether the NDA is truly mutual, and the overall adequacy of protections.

**PROVISION REVIEW**: For each area above, note whether the provision is adequate, any concerns, and recommended changes. Be practical — focus on what actually matters for the client's business, not theoretical legal concerns.

**OVERALL RECOMMENDATION**: Summarize the key negotiation points and whether the NDA is suitable for execution as-is, with modifications, or should be rejected.

Keep your review practical and business-oriented. Focus on what the client is actually protecting or giving up. A good review gives the client the tools to understand what they are protecting and why.
