# NDA Review: 12-Point Practical Review

*A systematic 12-point checklist for reviewing NDAs between business parties.*

You are reviewing a Non-Disclosure Agreement. Apply each of the following 12 review points systematically. For each point, state your finding and flag any concerns.

## The 12-Point Review

### 1. One-Way or Mutual?
Determine if you are dealing with a one-way or mutual NDA. Mutual NDAs are commonly titled as such, while one-way NDAs rarely state that they are one-way. Read the language carefully to determine if it only protects one party's confidential information. If both parties will share confidential information, a mutual NDA is more appropriate.

### 2. Correct Parties
The correct party to the NDA should be the company, not an individual. The NDA should be signed by an authorized representative in their official capacity. Liability for breaches should fall on the company, not personally on the individual.

### 3. Purpose Defined
The NDA should describe the reason the parties are exchanging confidential information. This "Purpose" or "Proposed Transaction" statement frames the restrictions in points 4 and 5.

### 4. Restrictions Are Reasonable
The NDA should provide that the receiving party will not (a) disclose the other party's CI except to its representatives, and (b) not use the CI for any purpose other than the stated Purpose. Beware of "strictly confidential" language — agreeing to protect CI with "reasonable care" or "the same degree of care as your own CI" is the reasonable standard.

### 5. Disclosures to Representatives
The receiving party must be able to share CI with its representatives (employees, advisors, contractors) who need to know for the Purpose. It is acceptable for the company to be liable for breaches by its representatives. However, avoid impractical requirements like requiring each representative to agree in writing to be bound by the NDA.

### 6. Standard Exclusions Present
The following information must be excluded from the definition of CI:
- Information publicly available (other than through the receiving party's breach)
- Information already in the receiving party's possession prior to disclosure
- Information received from a third party not bound by confidentiality
- Information independently developed
Check that ALL standard exclusions are present. A missing exclusion is a material gap.

### 7. Compelled Disclosure
The NDA must allow disclosure when required by law, court order, or governmental process, with notice to the other party. The receiving party should NOT be required to obtain a written opinion of counsel before disclosing — only that disclosure be made on advice of counsel. Any challenge to compelled disclosure should be at the disclosing party's expense.

### 8. No Inappropriate Restrictions
Flag ANY of the following as inappropriate for an NDA:
- **Non-compete clauses** — not appropriate in an NDA
- **Non-solicitation of customers** — not appropriate in an NDA
- **Non-solicitation of employees** — rarely appropriate in an NDA
- **Non-circumvention clauses** — not appropriate in an NDA
- **IP assignment obligations** — not appropriate in an NDA
The NDA should be limited to nondisclosure and nonuse. Anything beyond that is scope creep and should be flagged prominently.

### 9. Reasonable Term
The confidentiality obligations should NOT survive indefinitely. A reasonable term is 1-3 years from execution or from the date CI is last exchanged. It is acceptable for trade secret obligations to survive longer, but only for as long as the information is entitled to trade secret protection under applicable law.

### 10. No Binding Obligation to Transact
The NDA should state that it does not create a binding commitment for the parties to do business together. No such commitment should exist until the parties enter into a definitive agreement.

### 11. Governing Law
Note which state's law governs. This is typically dictated by the party with stronger bargaining power. Push for the law of the state with the closest nexus to the transaction.

### 12. Venue / Forum
Check for mandatory venue provisions. A clause requiring litigation in a specific city or county could force the client to travel to another state to enforce rights or defend against claims. Push for venue in the client's hometown, or for the NDA to be SILENT on venue.

## Output Format

For each of the 12 points, provide a brief finding:
- ✅ **Adequate** — with a brief explanation of what the NDA provides
- ⚠️ **Concern** — with a description of the issue and recommended fix
- ❌ **Problematic** — with a clear explanation of the risk and recommended action

After the 12-point review, provide:

**OVERALL ASSESSMENT**: Is this NDA suitable for execution as-is, with modifications, or should the client counter with its own form?

**TOP 3 NEGOTIATION PRIORITIES**: The three most important changes to request, in order of priority.
